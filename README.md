# DocumentVerification

This is a Machine Learning Project which enables us to successfully verify the documents like Aadhar Card, PAN Card, and Cheque Leaf. 
This model is based on Deep Learning and utilizes CNN Model for training on image dataset.
The dataset has been taken from Kaggle. 
The model also utilizes VGG16, pretrained model from Tensorflow as Feature Extractor.

The model also provides an API for performing Optical Charcater Recoginition (OCR) on these documents. 
The OCR has been performed using EasyOCR. 
The API has been made using Flask.
